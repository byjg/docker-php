# Building the image

Docker PHP Image uses [buildah](https://buildah.io/) 
to build a compatible [OCI container image](https://opencontainers.org/).

The image is compatible to all platforms, and it is capable to run on docker, 
podman, kubernetes and any other compatible with the OCI specification.

## Preparing the environment

Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* buildah

There is no necessary have docker installed, however you need to have the `buildah`
on your machine. 

If you are using an ubuntu/debian system you can use the provided script
`install-buildah-ubuntu.sh` to install it. 

## Command to build

```text
usage: build.py [-h] [--debug] [--build-base]
                [--build-cli] [--build-fpm]
                [--build-fpm-apache] [--build-fpm-nginx]
                [--push] 
                version
```

You can build one image only, but you need to make sure you have the `base` 
on your machine.
